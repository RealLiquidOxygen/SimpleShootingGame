# SimpleShootingGame
It is just a basic point and shoot game. I only did this to see if it is possible based on how I think it should work.

THe object collision is very glitchy, so feel free to fix it in basic stage before you use for something else.

The solution is quite simple, I just don't feel like it. 

I used a star war picture in this project, It does not belong to me. I am just starting it out loud. Free free to replace it if you want.
